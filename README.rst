GLShell
============

``GLShell`` is an integrated development environment (IDE) enhanced with OpenGL rendering.

It uses integrated terminals in tabs to support full versions of all common editors such as Emacs, Vim, Nano, and Pico.  File browsing is enhanced with 3D OpenGL visualization of directory and file trees using force-directed placement. The underlying terminal emulation was originally forked from Siva Chandran's TermEmulator project (https://github.com/sivachandran/TermEmulator).

Run with: `cd GLShell && python3 glShell.py`
